          <p>
            I'm <strong>Mursith Sharma</strong>, a passionate tech enthusiast focused on <span class="highlight">Cybersecurity</span> and <span class="highlight">Full Stack Web Development</span>. My journey began with a curiosity for how websites and networks work—and it has now evolved into a deep expertise in securing systems and building modern, scalable web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the realm of <strong>Cybersecurity</strong>, I focus on vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, secure coding, and ensuring data privacy. I have explored tools like Wireshark, Burp Suite, Nmap, and Metasploit, which help me analyze threats, audit networks, and safeguard sensitive data. I believe security should be baked into development, not added later.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong>, I’ve worked on various projects combining frontend and backend technologies. From building responsive UI using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and React, to managing databases and writing backend logic in PHP, MySQL, and .NET, I enjoy every part of the development lifecycle. My projects reflect a blend of usability, scalability, and security.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have worked on school management systems, library portals, online shopping carts, and QR code tools. My goal is to build user-centric applications that are not only functional but also secure and efficient.

        <h2 class="section-subtitle">Future Expectations</h2>
        <p>
          As I move forward in my career, my goal is to become a Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) and lead secure application development in enterprise environments. I aim to collaborate with organizations to build scalable and secure applications, reduce cyber risks, and empower users with better digital safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m constantly learning and staying updated with the latest technologies in AI-driven security, secure DevOps (DevSecOps), and cloud-based architectures. I see myself not only as a developer but as a security-focused architect who bridges functionality with protection.
